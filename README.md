# Pheidippides: Email framework

Pheidippides is a framework for HTML emails that introduces JavaScript functionality. <br />
This feature helps in designing complicated email flows.

## Functionality
For a new project, you need to download the repository. <br /><br />
There are several files: <br />

<ul>
<li>HTMLEmail.js is for your markup.</li> <br />
<li>Styles.js is for your global styles.</li> <br />
<li>preprocess.js updates your JS files to index.html.</li> <br />
<li>index.html is the clean markup.</li>
</ul>

As you can see, using the .js extension for markup allows you to leverage the advantages of its language. <br />
The possibilities are limited only by your needs. Personally, I use it for reusable templates, changing variables, improving markup using map and filter methods, and so on.
